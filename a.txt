qqqdFrst, we calculate the potential capacity of the render string using fold
. We have to loop through the chars of the row_content and if the char is 
a tab, we add 8 else we add 1. After setting the capacity, we then go 
through the chars to check whether the current character is a tab. If it is,
we append one ssdffsdfsfdspace (because each tab must advance the cursor forward at least 
one column), and then append spaces until we get to a tab stop, which is a 
column thatis divisible by 8.
